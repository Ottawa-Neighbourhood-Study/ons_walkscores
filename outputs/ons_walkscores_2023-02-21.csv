Origin points were taken from the Pseudo-Household Demographic Distribution (PHH) data file produced by the Government of Canada, filtered to point types 3 and 4 (points on non-highway roads). Then, for each neighbourhood, either 100 PHHs or the maximum number available within their boundaries were selected.
